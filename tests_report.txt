IMPLEMENTATIONS PROBLEMS:
- the search bar is not working anymore

- the offer page, once user enters an offer, redirects to "my products" page,
it should redirect to "my bids"
- the cart is accessible when the user is not logged/registered

CSS stuffs:
- the footer is not fixed at the bottom in profile / login/ logout
- CVC card should be 3 numbers (max_lenght)
